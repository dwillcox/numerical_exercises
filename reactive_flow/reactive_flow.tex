\section{Introduction}

Many astrophysical problems involve modeling nuclear (or chemical)
reactions coupled with hydrodynamics.  Astrophysical reacting flows
share a lot of similarities with terrestrial combustion, including
both subsonic (deflagrations) and supersonic (detonations) burning
fronts.  Nice discussions of the physics of reacting flows can be
found in, e.g., \cite{oranboris, peters:2000}


For multifluid flows, the Euler equations are
augmented with continuity equations for each of the nuclear (or chemical) species.  If we denote the density of species $k$ as
$\rho_k$, then conservation of mass for each species individually
implies:
\begin{equation}
\label{react:eq:partialdensitycont}
\ddt{\rho_k} + \nabla \cdot (\rho_k \Ub) = 0
\end{equation}
Summing Eq.~\ref{react:eq:partialdensitycont} over $k$ gives us back
the mass contunity equation, since $\sum_k \rho_k = \rho$.  The
$\rho_k$ are sometimes called {\em partial densities}.  Note that
using both Eq.~\ref{react:eq:partialdensitycont} 
and the normal mass continuity equation for $\rho$ overspecifies 
the system.

It is often
easier to define a mass fraction of species $k$, $X_k$, as
\begin{equation}
X_k = \frac{\rho_k}{\rho}
\end{equation}
and it is easy to see that $\sum_k X_k = 1$, and 
\begin{equation}
\label{react:eq:partialrho}
\frac{\partial (\rho X_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot  (\rho X_k \Ub) = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{exercise}[Species advection]
Using the continuity equation, show that we can write
Eq.~\ref{react:eq:partialrho} as an advection equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial X_k}{\partial t} + \Ub \cdot \nabla X_k = 0
\end{equation}
or 
\begin{equation}
\DDt{X_k} = 0
\end{equation}
\end{exercise}

This latter form says that as a fluid element advects with the flow,
its composition does not change.  However, reactions can turn one
species into another, so for reacting flow, $DX_k/Dt \ne 0$.  If we
define the creation rate for species $k$ as $\omegadot_k$, then we
have:
\begin{equation}
\DDt{X_k} = \omegadot_k
\end{equation}
Since $\sum_k X_k = 1$, it must be that $\sum_k \omegadot_k = 0$.

Reactions will also release (or consume) energy, due to the change in
nuclear or chemical binding energy.  This energy will be a source to
the internal energy.  In particular, our first law of thermodynamics
now has a source:\MarginPar{this assumes chemical
  equilibrium}
\begin{equation}
T ds = de + p d \left( \frac{1}{\rho}\right ) = q_\mathrm{react}
\end{equation}
where $q_\mathrm{react}$ is the specific energy release due to
reactions (energy / mass).  Following a fluid element, this takes the
form:
\begin{equation}
T\DDt{s} = \DDt{e} + p \DDt{(1/\rho)} = \Hnuc
\end{equation}
Where now $\Hnuc$ is the time-rate of energy release per unit mass
($dq_\mathrm{react}/dt$).

An additional energy source that we often consider along with reactions
is thermal diffusion.  Fick's law says that the heat flux is proportional
to $\nabla T$, so we write:
\begin{equation}
F_\mathrm{cond} = -\kth \nabla T
\end{equation}
as the conductive heat flux.  Here the `$-$' indicates that heat flows
from hot to cold and $\kth$ is the thermal conductivity.  See
\S~\ref{sec:diffusion} for more discussion.

The conservative Euler equations with reactive and diffusive source terms
appear as:
\begin{align}
\ddt{\rho} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \Ub) &= 0 \\
\ddt{\rho X_k} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \Ub X_k) &= \rho \omegadot_k \\
\ddt{(\rho \Ub)} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \Ub \Ub) + \nabla p &= 0 \\
\ddt{(\rho E)} + \nabla \cdot (\rho E \Ub + p \Ub ) &= \nabla \cdot (\kth \nabla T) + \rho \Hnuc
\end{align}
We'll write the heat sources simply as $H$, 
\begin{equation}
H = \Hnuc + \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla \cdot \kth \nabla T
\end{equation}

In primitive form, the derivation of the pressure equation is a
complex.  Previously, we found the pressure evolution in the absence
of sources by differentiating pressure along streamlines
(Eq.~\ref{eq:euler:presnosource}):
\begin{equation}
\frac{Dp}{Dt} = \left . \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho} \right |_s
     \DDt{\rho} + 
     \left . \frac{\partial p}{\partial s} \right |_\rho
     \DDt{s}
\end{equation}
where, as before, we recognize that $\Gamma_1 \equiv \partial \log p/\partial \log \rho |_s$.
Now, however, we have an entropy source, so $Ds/Dt \ne 0$.  
The Maxwell relations\footnote{see, for instance, \cite{shu}, for some discussion
on these relations} tell us that
\begin{equation}
\partial p/\partial s |_\rho = \rho^2 \partial T/\partial \rho |_s
\end{equation}
This gives us the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{Dp}{Dt} = \frac{p}{\rho} \Gamma_1 \frac{D\rho}{Dt} +
     \left . \rho^2 \frac{\partial T}{\partial \rho} \right |_s
     \frac{H}{T}
\end{equation}

We need an expression for $\partial T/\partial \rho |_s$ in terms of
derivatives of $\rho$ and $T$ (since that is what our equations of
state typically provide).  Consider $\Gamma_1$, with $p = p(\rho, T)$:
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_1 = \frac{\rho}{p} \left . \frac{dp}{d\rho} \right |_s
  = \frac{\rho}{p} \left [ p_\rho + p_T \left . \frac{dT}{d\rho} \right |_s \right ]
\end{equation}
where we use the shorthand $p_\rho \equiv \partial p/\partial \rho |_T$ and
$p_T \equiv \partial p/\partial T |_\rho$.  This tells us that
\begin{equation}
  \left . \frac{\partial T}{\partial \rho} \right |_s = \frac{p}{\rho p_T} (\Gamma_1 - \chi_\rho)
\end{equation}
where $\chi_\rho \equiv \partial \log p / \partial \log \rho |_T$.  To further simplify this,
we use some standard relations for general equations of state
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Gamma_1}{\chi_\rho} = \frac{c_p}{c_v}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  c_p - c_v = \frac{p}{\rho T} \frac{\chi_T^2}{\chi_\rho}
\end{equation}
with $\chi_T \equiv \partial \log p / \partial \log T |_\rho$
(see, e.g., \cite{HKT} for both of these relations).  These allow us to write
\begin{equation}
  \left . \frac{\partial T}{\partial \rho} \right |_s = \frac{p\chi_T}{\rho^2 c_v}
\end{equation}

Putting this all together, we have:
\begin{equation}
\frac{Dp}{Dt} = \frac{p}{\rho}\Gamma_1  \frac{D\rho}{Dt}
   + \frac{p \chi_T}{c_v T} H
\end{equation}
and using the continuity equation, $D\rho/Dt = -\rho \nabla \cdot \Ub$, 
we finally have:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reacting:p}
\ddt{p} + \Ub \cdot \nabla p + \Gamma_1 p \nabla \cdot \Ub = \Gamma_1 p \sigma H
\end{equation}
where we defined
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{\partial p/\partial T |_\rho}{\rho c_p \partial p/\partial \rho |_T}
\end{equation}
The $\sigma$ notation follows from \cite{ABRZ:II}.

The primitive variable is then
\begin{align}
\ddt{\rho} + \Ub \cdot \nabla \rho + \rho \nabla \cdot \Ub &= 0\\
\ddt{\Ub} + \Ub \cdot\nabla \Ub + \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p &= 0\\
\ddt{p} + \Ub \cdot \nabla p + \Gamma_1 p \nabla \cdot \Ub &= \Gamma_1 p \sigma H \\
\ddt{X_k} + \Ub \cdot \nabla {X_k} &= \omegadot_k 
\end{align}

Finally, we can derive a temperature evolution equation following the 
method from \S~\ref{sec:euler:otherthermo}.  We find
\begin{equation}
c_v \DDt{T} = \left ( \left . \frac{\partial e}{\partial \rho} \right |_T - \frac{p}{\rho} \right ) \nabla \cdot \Ub
  + H
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
c_p \DDt{T} = \left ( \frac{1}{\rho} - \left . \frac{\partial h}{\partial p} \right |_T \right ) \DDt{p}
 + H
\end{equation}
depending on whether we start with $e$ or $h$.  


\section{Operator splitting approach}

Using operator splitting, we separate the equations into hydrodynamics
and reactive parts and we do these operations in turn.  Following the
ideas from \S~\ref{sec:multiphys:diffreact}, we perform the update
in stages.  If we denote the reaction update operator as $R_{\Delta t}$
and the hydrodynamics operator as $A_{\Delta t}$, then our update 
appears as:
\begin{equation}
  \Uc^{n+1} = R_{\Delta t/2} A_{\Delta t} R_{\Delta t/2} \Uc^n
\end{equation}

To make it more explicit, we write out system as:
\begin{equation}
\ddt{\Uc} + \nabla \cdot \Fb(\Uc) = \Rc(\Uc)
\end{equation}
where $\Rc = (0, \omegadot_k, 0, \rho \Hnuc)^\intercal$ is the vector
of reactive sources.  The advance through $\Delta t$ in time is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Evolve reaction part for $\Delta t/2$}.

  We define $\Uc_i^\star$ as the result of integrating
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Uc_i}{dt} = \Rc(\Uc_i)
  \end{equation}
  over $t \in [t^n, t^{n+\myhalf}]$ with initial conditions, 
  $\Uc_i(t^n) = \Uc_i^n$.

\item {\em Solve the hydrodynamics portion for $\Delta t$, beginning
    with the state $\Uc^\star$}
   %
   \begin{equation}
     \frac{\Uc^{\star\star}_i - \Uc^\star_i}{\Delta t} =
      \frac{\Fb^\exx(\Uc^{\star,n+\myhalf}_{i-\myhalf}) - \Fb^\exx(\Uc^{\star,n+\myhalf}_{i+\myhalf})}{\Delta x}
   \end{equation}
  where $\Uc^{\star,n+\myhalf}_{i-\myhalf}$ is the predict interface
  state (using the ideas from \S~\ref{sec:onedrecon}), beginning with
  the state $\Uc^\star$.  Note that $\Rc$ does not appear here
  explicitly.

  Alternately, we
  could use the MOL hydrodynamics update here, but the basic idea will
  be the same---the hydrodynamics does not explicitly see the reaction
  terms.

\item {\em Evolve reaction part for $\Delta t/2$}

  We reach the final update, $\Uc^{n+1}$, by integrating
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{d\Uc}{dt} = \Rc(\Uc)
  \end{equation}
  over $t \in [t^{\myhalf}, t^{n+1}]$ with initial conditions
    $\Uc(t^{n+\myhalf}) = \Uc^{\star\star}$.

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Adding species to hydrodynamics}

In the hydrodynamics algorithm, we neglect the diffusion and reaction terms.  Their
effects are incorporated implicitly by performing the hydrodynamics
update starting with the state that has already experienced burning.
\begin{align}
\ddt{\rho} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \Ub) &= 0 \\
\ddt{(\rho X_k)} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \Ub X_k) &= 0 \\
\ddt{(\rho \Ub)} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \Ub \Ub) + \nabla p &= 0 \\
\ddt{(\rho E)} + \nabla \cdot (\rho E \Ub + p \Ub ) &= 0
\end{align}



When we now consider our primitive variables: $\qb = (\rho, u, p, X_k)$,
we find
\begin{equation}
\Ab(\qb) = \left ( \begin{array}{cccc} u  & \rho     & 0      &  0\\
                                  0  &  u       & 1/\rho &  0\\
                                  0  & \Gamma_1 p & u      &  0\\
                                  0  & 0        & 0      & u \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
There are now 4 eigenvalues, with the new one also being simply $u$.
This says that the species simply advect with the flow.  The right
eigenvectors are now:
\begin{equation}
\rb^\evm = \left ( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ -c/\rho \\ c^2 \\ 0\end{array} \right )
%
\qquad
\rb^\evz = \left ( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0  \\ 0\end{array} \right )
%
\qquad
\rb^\evzs{X} = \left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0  \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right )
%
\qquad
\rb^\evp = \left ( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ c/\rho \\ c^2 \\ 0 \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
corresponding to $\lambda^\evm = u -c$, $\lambda^\evz = u$,
$\lambda^\evzs{X} = u$, and $\lambda^\evp = u + c$.  We see that for
the species, the only non-zero element is for one of the $u$
eigenvectors ($\rb^\evzs{X}$).  This means that $X_k$ only jumps over
this middle wave.  In the Riemann solver then, there is no `star'
state for the species, it just jumps across the contact wave.

To add species into the solver, you simply need to reconstruct $X_k$
as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:compressible} to find the interface values.  If we 
are doing characteristic tracing, then we use this new $\Ab(\qb)$
and associated eigenvectors.  We then solve the Riemann problem, with $X_k$ on
the interface taken as simply the left or right state depending on the
sign of the contact wave speed, and do the conservative update for
$\rho X_k$ using the species flux.


One issue that can arise with species is that even if $\sum_k X_k = 1$
initially, after the update, that may no longer be true.  There are a
variety of ways to handle this:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can update the species, $(\rho X_k)$ to the new time and then
define the density to be $\rho = \sum_k (\rho X_k)$---this means that
you are not relying on the value of the density from the mass continuity
equation itself.

\item You can force the interface states of $X_k$ to sum to 1.  Because
the limiting is non-linear, this is where problems can arise.  If the
interface values of $X_k$ are forced to sum to 1 (by renormalizing), then
the updated cell-centered value of $X_k$ will as well.  This is the
approach discussed in \cite{plewamuller:1999}.

\item You can design the limiting procedure to preserve the summation
property.  This approach is sometimes taken in the combustion field.
For piecewise linear reconstruction, this can be obtained by computing
the limited slopes of all the species, and taking the most restrictive
slope and applying this same slope to all the species.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Integrating the reaction network}

The reactive portion of our operator split system is:
\begin{align}
\frac{dX_k}{dt} &= \omegadot_k \\
\frac{d(\rho e)}{dt} &= \rho \Hnuc
\end{align}
As written, this system is not closed without the equation of state,
since $\omegadot_k = \omegadot_k(\rho, T, X_k)$, and likewise for
$\Hnuc$.  Our temperature evolution equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
c_x \frac{dT}{dt} = \Hnuc
\end{equation}
where $c_x$ is $c_v$ or $c_p$, depending on the physical effects we are
trying to capture.
\if DEBUG
\footnote{formally, there should be a composition term here too, of the
form
\[
\sum_k \left . \frac{\partial e}{\partial X_k} \right |_{\rho,T} \frac{dX_k}{dt}  =
      \sum_k \mu_k \frac{dX_k}{dt} 
\]
where $\mu_k$ is the chemical potential.  But this term is zero if we
are in chemical equilibrium, which is usually assumed (but perhaps
should be checked) for astrophysical flows.  }
\fi
This difference only arises because we are neglecting the hydrodynamic
portions of the temperature evolution during the reaction step.

Many simulation codes neglect the evolution of temperature during the
reaction step (see, e.g., \cite{flash}).

An excellent introduction to integrating astrophysical nuclear
reaction networks is found in \cite{timmes_nets}.  The main issue with
reaction networks is that they tend to be stiff, which means that
implicit integration techniques are needed.  There are a number of
well-tested, freely available implicit ODE integrators
(e.g.~\cite{vode}).

For stiff systems, you need to supply both a righthand side routine
and a Jacobian routine\footnote{although this could be calculated via
  finite-differences if needed}.


\subsection{Incorporating explicit diffusion}



\section{Burning modes}


\subsection{Convective burning}


\subsection{Deflagrations}

A deflagration or flame is a subsonic burning front that propagates
via a balance of diffusion and reactions.  Thermal diffusion raises
the temperature of fuel ahead of the flame to ignition and the energy
release heats the ash, keeping the thermal gradient needed for
diffusion.  In terrestrial flames, species diffusion can be important
as well, but this is usually negligible in astrophysical flames.

Because the burning front is subsonic, sound waves can communicate
across the flame and therefore the fuel and ash are at the same
pressure.  The temperature jump across the flame means that the
density will drop behind the flame to preserve the constant pressure.
Our temperature evolution equation, taking $Dp/Dt = 0$, is
\begin{equation}
\rho c_p \DDt{T} = \nabla \cdot \kth \nabla T + \rho \Hnuc
\end{equation}

We can estimate the timescale for diffusion by neglecting the reactions
and writing
\begin{equation}
\DDt{T} = \frac{1}{\rho c_p} \nabla \cdot \kth \nabla T \approx \mathcal{D} \nabla^2 T
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D} = \kth/(\rho c_p)$ is the diffusion coefficient
(assuming $\rho c_p$ is spatially constant). Dimensional analysis suggests that the 
diffusion timescale is then
\begin{equation}
t_\mathrm{diff} \approx \frac{\delta^2}{\mathcal{D}}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the width of the region where diffusion takes
place---we'll identify this as the flame thickness.

Similarly, we can estimate the reaction timescale by considering
\begin{equation}
\rho c_p \DDt{T} = \rho \Hnuc
\end{equation}
and writing
\begin{equation}
t_\mathrm{burn} \approx \frac{c_p T}{\Hnuc}
\end{equation}
We can alternately expand $\Hnuc$ in terms of temperature
if we wish to capture some of the temperature sensitivity.

Equating these timescales gives
\begin{equation}
\delta \sim \left ( \frac{\kth T}{\rho \Hnuc} \right )^{1/2}
\end{equation}
which is an estimate of the flame thickness.  We can define the flame
speed as the time it takes to burn through this thickness:
\begin{equation}
v_f \sim \frac{\delta}{t_\mathrm{burn}} \sim \left ( \frac{\kth \Hnuc}{\rho c_p T} \right )^{1/2}
\end{equation}
We note the main dependences are:
\begin{equation}
v_f \sim \sqrt{\kth \Hnuc} \qquad \delta \sim \sqrt{\frac{\kth}{\Hnuc}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Detonations}
